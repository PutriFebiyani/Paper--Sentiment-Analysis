# Abstract
**Abstract**—Presidential elections in Indonesia are crucial for democracy, with social media playing a significant role in shaping public opinion amidst the challenges of misinformation. Sentiment analysis using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms can yield predictive insights that enhance political strategies. Random Forest is better at handling overfitting and complexity, while Decision Tree is easier to interpret but prone to overfitting, providing insights to boost political participation and decision-making. This study employs Python to predict the impact of the Indonesian presidential election by leveraging data mining techniques, specifically Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms. Twitter data sourced from Mendeley Data comprises 30,000 tweets about Indonesian presidential candidates, which are processed through steps like cleaning, normalization, and tokenization. Model training and evaluation use accuracy metrics and confusion matrices to assess performance. Random Forest shows better recall for the positive class, while Decision Tree excels in precision. Decision Tree has a slightly higher accuracy (83.93%) compared to Random Forest (83.22%), helping to enhance political strategies by forecasting public opinion.

## I. INTRODUCTION
The presidential election in Indonesia is a critical moment in the democratic journey. Since the democratic transition in 1998, Indonesia has conducted eight direct presidential elections, demonstrating an increasing political participation. In this digital age, social media has become the primary platform for expressing political opinions, although misinformation poses a serious challenge. Sentiment analysis is an important tool for understanding public opinion and enhancing political participation.

## II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Sentiment analysis and election forecasting are vital in supporting presidential elections. Machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree and Random Forest are frequently utilized in election data analysis, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

## III. METHODOLOGY
This research uses data mining techniques with Python to predict presidential election outcomes. The process includes data collection via Twitter, data cleaning and normalization, labeling, model training, and evaluation.

## IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Data collected from Mendeley Data consists of 30,000 entries processed for analysis. The cleaning process involves removing irrelevant text, normalization, and tokenization. The model is trained using 75% of the data for training and 25% for testing. Evaluation results show that Random Forest performs better in recall, while Decision Tree achieves higher precision. Both models provide critical insights for political strategies.
